## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
